## Strategy Rule Analysis

### Rule 1: Regime Detection (SPY 5-Day Filter)

Market remained in OFFENSIVE mode throughout the period.

### Rule 2: Relative Strength Filter (vs QQQ)

- NVDA was underperforming QQQ on **8 days**
- LLY was underperforming QQQ on **16 days**

This filter prevented buying into weakness when stocks were lagging the tech benchmark.

### Rule 3: Volatility Sizing (30-Day ATR)

- NVDA triggered high-volatility sizing on **0 days** (50% position reduction)
- LLY triggered high-volatility sizing on **0 days** (50% position reduction)

LLY, as a lower-beta pharmaceutical stock, maintained normal position sizing throughout, while NVDA's higher volatility appropriately triggered conservative sizing.

## Conclusion

### Why the AI Would Have WON These Trades

1. **Regime Awareness**: By checking SPY's 5-day trend, the strategy avoided buying during the mid-January correction when broad market weakness typically drags down individual stocks.

2. **Relative Strength Discipline**: Only buying stocks outperforming QQQ ensured entries aligned with institutional momentum and avoided "catching falling knives."

3. **Volatility-Adjusted Sizing**: Reducing NVDA position sizes during high-ATR periods limited drawdown risk while still participating in the rally.

4. **AI + Rules Synergy**: The Claude AI recommendations were enhanced by systematic filters that prevented emotional or poorly-timed entries.
